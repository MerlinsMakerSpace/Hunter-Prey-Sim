This is a simple Hunter/Prey-Simulation I wrote with a classmate when I was studying Mechanical Engineering. It was the class capstone. Obviously I would do certain things differently now, but its here for completions sake.
One version is with starting parameters, the other one asks the user for the parameters.
Added are some example plots, I think the foxes ran out of space?
